—In eg. 5 dim, why do the 5 psi matrices obey a different algebra than eg. the first 5 psi matrices of 8 dim?

Can be useful in fixed N

  Does antisymmetrization include normalizing?

—How does the Majorana algebra make sense? {\psi^i,\psi^i}=1?



—What is the definition of b^i at 2.1 in Fu?



—How to cite from Arxiv, books



—Is the ground state 0 energy?

yes, in SUSY

—Are energy eigenstates necessarily fermionic or bosonic?

yes 

—Last two expressions in equation 5.5.

i in denominator, free theory

—For N=2 SUSY, in what sense is \overbar conjugation? 
  Simply complex conjugation?
  For C vs for \psi?
  if so, how can C\bar{C} be less than 0?



—Second reader



—For future 

anticommutation relations
introduce supersymmetry 
  with supersymmetric harmonic oscillator 
maybe put dirac equation in introduction 
fix title
fourier decomposition of field?
