Comments in conclusion 
SO much work on entropy section 

Ask Verlinde 
  plot of hamiltonian?
  — yes
  What is the entropy in Fu? (p 29)
  — 
  Are the new figures good? 
  — yes
  Symmetry, group, generator, algebra, charge? 
  —
  Extensive: D_GS or DoF scale with N? 
  — 
  Are the Hamiltonian plots nice?
  — yes
  We vs. I vs. this paper
  — Don’t use I, ‘we’ makes sense when with the reader, or use ‘the section’
